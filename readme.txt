Hi there,

Login functionality
Adding products to the cart
Payment using COD and Momo
Confirmation of orders before placing them successfully
One of the main requirements of this project is to develop a WinForm application that allows accountants to manage the company's import invoice, products, customers, view and update order statuses.
